    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <p>This set of videos was mostly concerned with getting us aquainted bot with shooting video, and working in adobe premiere. 
    as such they're pretty basic, but I think they turned out well for the most part.</p>

        <h1>Team shoot</h1>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/230968298" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>In this video, pairs of us were tasked with following a very specific set of directions that were to be completed at very specific times. Unfortunately the picture of the directions we were using had the times for these actions cut out. Our timing as a little bit off to say the least.</p>

        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/232405253" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This videos objective was simply to give a very brief introduction to our videos in 4 locations with different moods. I think I succeeded in that respect, and just barely made it into the time restriction</p>

       <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/234141933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>For this video we just needed to get a one minute interview of someone with clear audio, and cuts to b-roll to make it more interesting. I think it turned out well.</p>

       <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/234142216" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This video was meant to be a series of quick shots including motion in the subject, the camera or both. I think I achieved those goals, but out of all the videos in this group, this one was definitely the most flat, at least for me.</p>

        <h1>Transitions</h1>
       <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/235188500" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>For this video we had to transition between ten shots, half of our own footage, and half found footage, using themes of form, color motion etc.. Along with this we had to add found audio. I made an effort to make the transitions match the beat of the music, and the transitions clear. I’m happy with how it turned out</p>

       <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/235245897" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This video just had to combine footage from the other videos with found audio and be exactly 16 seconds long. This one’s friggin goofy, and for that reason it’s my favorite in this group.</p>
