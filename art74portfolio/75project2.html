    <h1>Project 2</h1>
    <p>This set of videos was all aboutsurveillance and point of view, basically putting caera in odd places not consistent
    with what we think of as a standard narrative.</p>

        <p>For this project the whole goal was to make a very brief kind of documentary or how-to video of how we made it. Me being the dink that I am, it was only after I got back from walking the few miles to and from the beach that I realized I had to do this. So I had to improvise. Enjoy my dulcet tones.</p>

        <p>This project was pretty straight forward. All we needed was a twenty or so second time lapse with at least two angles of the same location. I used Natural Bridges Beach, a state park near my house, as the location. The music is the opening to "Roundabout" by <i>Yes</i>.</p>

       <p>This video was all about fallowing the theme of surveillance by putting a camera set to record somewhere odd. Time was short for this one so my location was one closer to home, my refrigerator, or rather, my parents' refrigerator. </p>

         <p>
As humans we spend so much time with our normal perception that it seems normal to not even think about what life might be like if we saw the world from a different perspective. Well, I ain't one to abide by normalcy, so I sought to answer the one really important question facing our nation. What if our eyes were located somewhere else on our body, somewhere that's constantly in motion? Thus the hand-cam was born to document a day in my life from an odd angle.</p>
