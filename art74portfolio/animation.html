    <h1>Animation</h1>
    <p>This project kind of leads off from the montage. We were meant to use the images from our montage, and put them together into an animation using Adobe Photoshop, while exploring a theme that could continue off of the montage, or be entirely new. I chose to explore a new theme, in this case how nature and humanity seem to be able to recoverfrom the worst catastrophies. We later added a soundscape to the animations in an attempt to enhance them.

        <p>As mentioned above, we used Photoshop to make these animations. I worked almost entirely using keyframes. I think there was one or two points where I did a little work
        by animating frame by frame, but I used that technique sparingly. <br><br>
            When we started this projet I was fairly unfamiliar with the animation end of Photoshop, and it took me a while to really get aquainted with how things worked. 
            It may not be the prettiest animation in the world, but I'm proud of the amount of 
            effort I put into it, if not the animation itself.

        <p>For the sound we had to either create or find public domain clips online. I ended up
            doing a little bit of both. The majority I made using an old microphone I had lying around, and whatever odds and ends I had around my room, banging pencils on my desk
            messing around with the distortion on my guitar, and what have you. The few I found online were downloaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Web Archive</a>
